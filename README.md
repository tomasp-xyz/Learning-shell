# Learning-shell
Studying shell scripting

Objectives for now:
1. Get through Linux shell scripting course on Udemy
2. Write a script to automate WireGuard deployment for Debian-based OS (thought came from Helium article I wrote a while back)
3. Write down ideas for OpenWRT/RutOS based issues and/or requests to possibly try and script them in the future

Will need to start networking repository soon enough, specifically for tools that I use daily to have a point of reference in case of memory loss...
